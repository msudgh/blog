I'm Masoud Ghorbani, a software engineer currently living in Tehran who enjoys building out software, teams, contributing to open source projects, and writing code in `Node.js`, `Go` and `Elixir`.

Right now, I'm particularly interested in functional programming, distributed systems, observability, scalaibilty, and micro services.

This blog is a place where I can explore new ideas, experiment with different techniques, and muse on best practices. If you're interested in my thoughts on something, please let me know!

Away from the screen and keyboard, I can be found traveling, generally being outdoors, and playing games like an eternal novice.
